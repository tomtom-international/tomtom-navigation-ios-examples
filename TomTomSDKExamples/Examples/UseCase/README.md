# Simple navigation app using TomTom SDK

*Note: Navigation SDK for iOS is only available upon request. [Contact us](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-sdk-for-ios/request-access "Contact us") to get started.*

*Note: If you have not set up your development environment, please refer to the [Development Setup](../../../README.md) page.*

## Online Map Example

This example shows how to build a simple navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for iOS.
The application displays a map and shows the userâ€™s location. After the user selects a destination with a long press, the app plans a route and draws it on the map. Navigation is started automatically using the route simulation. 

For further explanations on the example provided can be found in this [tutorial](https://developer.tomtom.com/ios/navigation/documentation/use-cases/build-a-navigation-app).

## Offline Map Example

The offline map example shows how to use offline maps using the TomTom Navigation SDK for iOS.

Upon receiving the offline maps data and the map license from TomTom, copy the offline maps directory into the project's root folder, name it "Map" following the directory structure provided below, and change the map license in the `Keys.swift` file.

- Map
    - DATA
    - keystore.sqlite

*Note: "Offline Map Example" uses offline maps but uses an online route planner and navigation. Offline route planners and navigation will be provided.*

## Hybrid Map Example

The hybrid map example will be provided.
