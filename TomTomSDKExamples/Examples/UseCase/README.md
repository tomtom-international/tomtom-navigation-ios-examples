# Simple navigation app using TomTom SDK

*Note: Navigation SDK for iOS is only available upon request. [Contact us](https://developer.tomtom.com/tomtom-sdk-for-ios/request-access "Contact us") to get started.*

*Note: If you have not set up your development environment, please refer to the [Development Setup](../../../README.md) page.*

This example shows how to build a simple navigation application using the TomTom Navigation SDK for iOS.
The application displays a map and shows the userâ€™s location. After the user selects a destination with a long press, the app plans a route and draws it on the map. Navigation is started automatically using the route simulation. 

For further explanations on the example provided can be found in this [tutorial](https://developer.tomtom.com/ios/navigation/documentation/use-cases/building-a-navigation-app).
