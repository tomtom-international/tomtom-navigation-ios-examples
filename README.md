- [Project setup for CocoaPods]

## API Keys

In order to manage, create or delete your API keys, you need to have a [TomTom Developer Portal] account.
If you don't have one, you need to [register] for one.
Follow the steps from [How to get a TomTom API Key] to learn how to create an API key.

> **Note** Using an invalid API key will cause issues loading the map or running navigation.

In order to insert your API key in the project, you need to change the `Keys.swift` file.

```swift
enum Keys {
    static let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have a **black screen** when launching the Basic driving app, please follow the steps below.

- Check that you have updated the `API key` with yours in the `Keys.swift` file.
- Check that your `API key` is valid for the requested features
- Check your internet connection
